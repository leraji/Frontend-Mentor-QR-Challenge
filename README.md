## My process

After reviewing the design files (sketch file, images, style guide) created html markup with basic component elements, later adding css to style.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties



### What I learned

This project helped me learn the basic setup of github repo locally and online w publishing to github pages. It also helped with learning the basics of workflow using tools such as VSCode, Git, Slack & more. The basic layout of this project helped me review basic CSS properties and rules.

### Continued development

I want to focus on managing css rules better using better naming conventions & organizations. I plan on looking further into bem or other options. Also I need to work more towards mobile first and understanding media queries better.
